## üöÄ Running the Application Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and `npm` installed on your machine (used to run a simple local server).
*   A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
*   An **ElevenLabs API Key**. You can get one from the [ElevenLabs website](https://elevenlabs.io/). The free tier is sufficient to run this project.

### Step 1: Download the Project Files

Create a new folder for the project on your computer and save all the application files (`index.html`, `App.tsx`, `components/`, etc.) inside it, preserving the directory structure.

### Step 2: Configure API Keys

This is the most important step. The application needs API keys to communicate with Google and ElevenLabs. For local testing, you will insert your keys directly into the code.

#### **A. Google Gemini API Key**

You need to add your Gemini key in **two** files:

1.  **File 1: `services/geminiService.ts`**
    *   Open this file and find the line: `ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY });`
    *   Replace `process.env.API_KEY` with your actual API key string.
    *   **Change it to look like this:**
        ```typescript
        ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" });
        ```

2.  **File 2: `components/chatbot/ChatWindow.tsx`**
    *   Open this file and find the line: `const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY });`
    *   Make the same replacement with your API key string.
    *   **Change it to look like this:**
         ```typescript
        const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" });
        ```

#### **B. ElevenLabs API Key**

1.  **File: `hooks/useTextToSpeech.ts`**
    *   Open this file and find the line: `const ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = "sk_245e80971403c1e03b66fb839b7a56ac576920c60e5f2351";`
    *   The existing key may have expired or run out of quota. **Replace the key** with your own ElevenLabs API key.
    *   **Change it to look like this:**
        ```typescript
        const ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = "YOUR_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY_HERE";
        ```

### Step 3: Run a Local Web Server

Since the project uses ES modules (`import`/`export`), you cannot open `index.html` directly from your file system. You must serve it using a local web server.

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the root directory of the project (the folder where you saved `index.html`).
3.  **Install `http-server`**, a simple server package, by running this command:
    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    ```
4.  **Start the server** by running:
    ```bash
    http-server .
    ```

5.  The terminal will display a message with one or more URLs, such as:
    ```
    Available on:
      http://127.0.0.1:8080
      http://192.168.1.100:8080
    Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
    ```

### Step 4: Open the Application

1.  Open your web browser.
2.  Navigate to one of the URLs provided by `http-server` (e.g., **`http://localhost:8080`**).
3.  The Inclusive AI Learning Hub should now be running!
